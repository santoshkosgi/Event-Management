This gem transform an Array or Hash into a excel file using the spreadsheet gem.

  @users = User.all

  @users.to_xls
  @users.to_xls(:name => "Users")      # specifies the Sheet name (by default Sheet1)
  @users.to_xls(:headers => false)     # don't include headers
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, :role]) # include only these columns, on this order
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, {:company => [:name, :address]}]) # able to pick associations/called methods
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, {:company => [:name, :address]}], :headers => [:name, :company, :address]) # provide better names for the associated columns


== Example of use in Rails

In the controller where you want to export to excel, add the format.xls line.

  class UserController < ApplicationController

    def index
      @users = User.all

      respond_to do |format|
        format.html
        format.xml { render :xml => @users }
        format.xls { send_data @users.to_xls, :filename => 'users.xls' }
      end
    end
  end

== Requirements

On rails, you might want to modify config/initializers/mime_types.rb and register a custom mime type there:

  Mime::Type.register "application/vnd.ms-excel", :xls  

== Dependencies

* spreadsheet gem (automatically included if you require to_xls)

== Installing on rails 2.x

Include next gems in your environment.rb config file:

    config.gem 'to_xls'

Then execute

    rake gems:install


== Installing on rails 3.x

In your Gemfile

== ToXml::ArrayWriter

You can export to a file or spreadsheet book using the internal ToXml::ArrayWriter class:

    ToXls::ArrayWriter.new(users, :name => 'Users').write_io(file) # writes to a given file
    ToXls::ArrayWriter.new(users, :name => 'Users').write_book(book) # writes to a spreadsheet book (adds a new sheet)

The options of ArrayWriter.new(array, options) are the same as in to_xls.
